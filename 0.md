# $0

One of my favorite things about my youthful outlook on life was the fearing that I couldn't get to $0.

This is a topic I'm so excited to talk about because it builds on the premis and promise that the 100 Day project did in fact 1,000x the global GDP. Mind you the projections were negative, 2-3% *less* or pullback from the previous year (could be wrong). Either way, given the bountiful opportunities that have been afforded to us with the laggard, encumbant, & brazen slugish pace of rebuilding from the pandemic; not to mention the collective trauma felt as Prince Harry put it. Yes, $0. *ahem* Buf to finish this point, I do belive whole heartedly that the global, local, & forecasted measures of export, import, & household prospertity are outdated. More on this later...

Back to $0. Why do I care about depleting my assets, resources, & wealth accumulation in ~ 1-2 year cycles? By seeing my momey as a budget and not as am asset. Budgets that don't get used are indicators of bad forecasting of needs met with lagging lifestyle creep; desires that are 100% yours to justify; and givings that could be done in style, dignity, & "you got me next time" that are left on the table. I don't believe in hand outs, charity, nor giving thanks/back to the same person who extended me hand-crafted kindness, attentiom, and thoughtfulness.

My goal this year was to get to $0 and see the rest as being worthy of charity; which I intend to avoid at all costs. The budget, my savings & faith, ought to be invested in ways that help build, enable, and empower me to bring out my full self, my skills, & self-directive towards the causes, opportunities, & voids that I feel could be best met and filled by me uniquely. I live lavish, stylish, and splurge within my means; only defined by what I can justify to my self; sometimes reject the receipt for; and what has generally been consistent of my taste, pallate, and appetite over the years. As my homies like to say: "I like what I like; I don't second guess!" Just don't ask my mom or dad. They operate under different rules and consistently probably wonder if I got mixed up in the wromg crowd, birth, & whatever vice I'm testing God with. Rest assured, diplomacy, artistic abilities, and unwavering faith have indeed been passed down. The swagger, poise, & grit easily get overlooked by my desire to be adamant about not being humble, graceful, or timid. I just like to believe they don't get calls on the daily about me. My policy is that the world stops and rests at the doorstep and I've been blessed enough to have them welcome me home even after...sigh. "Where the * do I really even start..." I'm the exception in my entire extended family so I take advantage of all their collective contributions to humanity by living large and full. Something something zero-sum. Anyway, back to me...

* Isn't it scary to go to $0? Yes. Yes it is.
* What about helping your own first? If you give a penny to my family I will find you in the next life and kick your @
* What about building your own foundations? What? Does it look like I use a planner? :P
* What about the X group that is counting on you to do Y as you fail Z expectations and Zzzzz...sorry I couldn't hear you over my lost sleep in a decade run with expired marshmellows, iron grip on carrot supply chain, and notebook me and Wayne can give you for all the othet stupid questions

Okay? Well, isn't that just because you're X and are protected from Y and are literally the last Z that should be saying anything about Zzzz....couldn't hear you over you reading this.

Isn't that like myopic, selfish, privilaged, unhinged, and like...unfair...? Yes, yes it is. Welcome to assymetric gains. Looking forward to celebrating yours too
 

Well, that's easy for you to say but I'm X and gotta worry about Y and you have no idea about Z...? Yeah, and I know you got me next time!


Okay, well, if we all did that collectively wouldn't that generate so much economic activity, brand new cycles of growth, and a society that doesn't need social goodie-doings from anyone but those around us? :)

In God We Trust!
