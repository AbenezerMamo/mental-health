### 7-14

Taking a master class in how to dodge responsibilities. Did some essay, art, & poetry competitions that gained some recognition. I was a poet & wanted to do it all. During the summer, I spent time at a summer camp buildign model rocket engines, digital photography, 3D SketchUp, & robotics. Also spent a lot of time reading Anthony Horowitz, David Lubar, & Walter Issacson.

### 14-21

Started buildilng online gaming communities, software products, & ultimately a product managment career within consumer monetization at social media companies. Survived school just in time to run home and open my computer to manage 100+ game server instances running on barebones Debian with a massive gaming community. Also managed to take a leap of faith on Make School and my life changed forever. I was king of the nerds & the class clown. Spent my days obsessing over getting into YC - didn't. Decided I needed a rough lesson in product buildling so I took a PM internship at Ampush and my life changed drastically.

I learned that you have to stay 2 years at a company before you really learn anything. Began to put a premium on people over shiny new thing, money, & lateral jumps. Did an LA thing w/ Snap & got laid off but got to return to my SF family coming back to Twitter. Sat in rooms with everyone 10x smarter than me and twiddle my thumbs trying to figure out how to add value; it was not by coding, designing, marketing, or anything else that made me feel like I was still competent. All I had to do was help the team build a shared understanding of the problem by ensuring we're having the same conversation. Data, analytics, & infra planning became my focus so I can make up for my lack of leadership skills with actual credible evidence I can shove around. Also, ate a lot of protein bars at Twitter - $2.50 a piece so I think I robbed them dry by the end. Still same level.

I mastered avoiding "P.S. I love you too". Idk if you're welcome is warranted but seriously: we're welcome.

God willing, I'd like to take on a few ambitious goals:

1.) Get to $0 by the end of the year
2.) Find stability in habits, routines, & enviroment
3.) Phase 1 of revolution coming to public education - data infrastructure for provision data custodianship, policy propogation, & continous research-industry-dev cycle

#### 26

1. Make it to the NBA draft and win defensive player of the year
2. Phase 2 of revolution coming to public education - student communities extending across peers in 50 states with expert couseling. Including Food & Diet Social Products: Making access & consistency of nutrition the avenue to tackle mental health issues & promote active lifestyles in the mind & body
4. Report: How to cultivate American talent from coast to coast - from research universities, hedgefunds, to unicorn startups - to build a shared contract on how to pool together talent to build the future of education, state by state.

#### 27

1. Bring a championship to Bulls. Retire.
2. Phase 3 is to sprout the roots of what is to be the greatest revolution in mental health to aid those dealing with the burdon of college choices, carreer choices, job performance, and evolving social relationships throughout.
4. Report: Deriving insights from Phase 2, compile a report on how healthcare, correctional, recreational, & communal systems could learn from each other - coast to coast

#### 28

1. Self-study bar exam and take it in California. Pass.
2. Phase 4 of revolution coming to public education - adaptable pacing, pair-learning, & portfolios with YoY content continuity
3. Report: How to scale & extract learnings from K-12 to fit the continous, self-pased, & project-based life long education needed for working class to elevate their skills to the evolving needs & times of tomorrow's labor market. For some, new opportunities to impact education hands-on could drive field experts to bring battle-tested energy & strategy to help students find direct paths to sustainable & fulfiling work through job-ready apprentenship

Apparently this is when humans are supposed to have the greatest output to society, at least according to history. *shrug* I'll await God's next assignment for me but I hope racing, building a family, & landing helicopters with no power is somewhere in there.
