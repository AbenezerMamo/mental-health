# The pandemic was the revelation of the social virus years in the making

My hypothesis is that the relationship between man and woman has been so damaged that people felt it needed a restart. I don't think this should influence your sociological, spiritual, or scientific understanding of (not being witty) the past, present, or future but I think it's an opportunity for us to have a difficult conversation before we let the damage rock humanity to its core and leave our future generations in disgust, ruin, and shame.

1. I finally got my glow up recently
2. I lost my heart, had it broken, & lost my career / social life / and all the momentum I built having came to American at 10, moved to the valley after high school, and had a hockey stick of potential to be a cataylst for social good
3. When I finally got my physical, vocal, & emotional strength, I felt like I was left in the dust
4. I drank for the first and last time this year
5. After recovering from Addrral & Weed abuse, the loss of my relationship threw me back into it and a whirlwind of a year ending with an OD, a psychward involuntary commit, & a chance to show up for humanity and disuade fellow myopic nialists
6. I dedicated so much to protecting my privacy so I can champion for your kids and future generation so they could grow up with a chance to have independent thinking, creative freedom, and the chance to shed identities as they evolved with age. This year, it felt harder and harder than ever with every stumble
7. I discovered the greatest blessing as a Christian: that I, like my heart breaker, have free will. I know God has what I need tomorrow but it's my choice to show up to it and yours to take that from both God and my own accord
8. I asked God to let me live this life as my own and not one that would be a reflection, symbol, or image of Chrsitianity
9. I decided even suicidal thoughts wouldn't drive me into the CIA. I would make them too powerful.
10. I needed God to know that if I was going to lose my door to heaven, to take me now (100+ days ago) because it's the same door, same priority ticket, and same requirement for you and I: the born sinners. I need me some Jesus too.

Sigh....I'm going to pause there. It's been heavy on me and it's not any easier writing this. More on this when I'm emotionally avaliable for it...Until then, "I'm like go away..."
