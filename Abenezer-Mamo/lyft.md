# Lyft

There is this animation and dark dark UX in Lyft that starts the booking flow and then immediately transitions into a failed state to promot you to enter new payment information since the existing has failed.

While moving around and not currently on my ADHD medication, managing my finances has been diffucult and I've had to lean on my friends for help as I regained acccess to accounts and a grip on life. Yes, CIA, I'm not afraid to ask for help from friends and strangers - relax! Anyway, during this period has been one too many encounters with that dreaded animation and fail page.

From the bottom of my heart I beg of you to please change it and ask you to not cause me trauma and deep deep agony that has haunted me every time I call a ride; even when all my payment is figured out and squared out (no pun, I use Venmo). Seriously though, I am so heart broken and am very close to unleashing spite & the inner petty in me. I am scarred. Please. Stop. Find a better way.

Thank you,
loyal customer and yearly Pink subscriber

P.S. I enjoy mechanism design and can teach you an effective lesson in auction dynamics if you continue to be orthogonal to human service product design
