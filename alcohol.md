# Alcohol

After drinking for the first time this year, I found out my * doesn't go soft when I do so out of respect for the homies and my addictive personality, I decided it would be best to just stay clear. Mind you, I needed to confirm I wasn't Jesus Christ and obviously drinking seemed like the obvious thing to do. So I grabbed some hard stuff and the highest proof vodka I could get my hands on and do things like the life manual book suggested not to ;) To my delight, depressants are effective and yes they do alude a sense of confidence too. That being said, I proceeded to talk about the golden Cross like the homie and then realized this jerk probably got a deal with both. I shut the music off and decided it was time to watch some real ballers on TV. Sigh....After feeling defeated, I decided maybe some Pultzer winning leaders could inspire some change. Damn it. The whole set box was just set up the wrong way....

Alright, let's talk. I want to celebrate your wins and you deserve it - not hating. However, nothing. That's not my place. Let's take a step back. Why alcohol? Because weed is a potent force in the space but there's a catch to it...

One of my pet peeves was the drinking culture in tech and anyone that drinks and code I felt was a risk and a mennace to global scope safety. *ahem* "Bruh, pass it!!" Yeah, I don't think the double standards really clicked in for them...

Anyway, the thing about drinking is that it goes straight to your liver / kidney (idk I'm not a doc) Weed infused drinks unfortunately don't activate as quickly so the gap between you throwing it down and you thinking you could throw down have quite the time delta. Therefore, people I imagine pick what they can put down the fastest.

What's my point? I don't know. I just needed to rant about something to be hated by before ya'll got to fuzzy on me.

Marketing is though and I don't want to stand on a stool and talk down at you but stick to the car ads please. At least that's top 3 largest purchase you make as a human and it'll be a while before I can start wanting to flaunt on a Rolls. Damn you Drako. Too bad you didn't accept the Charger! (da-dum-dish) "I'm a drummer too!" :P
