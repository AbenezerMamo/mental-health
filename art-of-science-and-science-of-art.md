* Art is protected but science is advanced
* Anything can be art but not everything should be science
* Artists can make science fiction but scientists can't model art as fact
* You can't make art with science but you can produce artificats that artists can science into product
* You can make art a science but you can't break down art into science
* You can make artificial art with science but you can't seek intelligence as an art without a natural being
* You can centralize information, deprive central agency into communal intelligence; but you can only wish the proccess turns out well, and pray for wisdom
