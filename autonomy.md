# Autonomy

So I was reading the Apple privacy policy the other day...and came across the word "obtain".

On brand, I obviously hit the dictionary and came to a sudden realization that the antonyms were "relinquish" and "lose"

So I went on to search up "gain" and the antonym that shows up was "lose". "Relinquish" was not one of the antonyms.

*SHOOOOOOOOOOOK*


So you're telling me we "gain" autonomy and "lose" it? Do you get what's wrong with this sentence? It's a binary effect. It implies this bimodal state in which it treats autonomy as a 1 or 0.

.......

Now: "obtaining" autonomy would imply that the negation of it is the "relinquish" of it. This is a gradient - a loosening of what should begin as an iron grip.


We're doing ourselves a disservice if we don't find a bar of soap every time we use "gain" in lue of "obtain".
