# Calm

I get nervous and gittery a lot. You can tell when I repeat the same point in different words. "Kinda like....", "know what I mean", "bruh I * you not", "dude...dudeeee....dudeeeeee", "okay; listen to meeeeeeee", "*sigh* you know what...I'm so done with you", "bruh -_-", "i don't even wanna hear if it's about X", "do you have any idea...", "okay; I don't even *pauses* I need a moment to digest what you just said", "are you out of your mind", "listen here you little *", and other great hits

Being calm is wonderful. If I'm calm, just be worried. It means I'm not really calm. If I nervous and everything is on fire, eh - life's humming along.


This isn't an invitation for you psych majors to have a field day. This is a PSA that real life versions of the meme where the dog says "everything is fine" while carniage happens in the background exist.

Somewhere in some government branch I'm getting diagnosed for a CVS reciept long of things with every commit. My counter move: I am starting to care. Checkmate.
