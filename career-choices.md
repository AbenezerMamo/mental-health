# Career Choices

The topic of career choices isn't one that ends at the start of high school and that's an important point to begin with.

I had an odd dream today and it kind of touched on this topic. Why I'm having dreams to prepare and educate today's youth, I'll point you to boredom and solitude.

It went something like this:

1. Me - What am I good at or interested in
2. You - What do you need from me and how can I best align my stewardship with fulfillment
3. The world - What do I and you have that the world lacks or what have I understood about myself and those in my immediate surrounding that I served that could scale to the masses

That was of course a dream and it ended with me deciding to be a counselor at a small school in the mountains in the middle of no where. Give or take some existential romance debacles and beautiful water with my eyes twinkling upon discovering kayaking, it was rather mundane. I do have however have my own developed thoughts on the topic of figuring out what you wanna do in life. Without further ado...
 
### Understanding yourself

#### What do I care about?

#### What can I see myself doing to help?

#### What kind of help does the problem need, by the time I enter the field and by time I intend to leave my mark?

#### Who am I helping?

##### Am I helping those who can't access a solution?

###### Am I making it cheaper?

###### Am I making it self-serve?

##### Am I helping those who aren't making effective use of existing solutions?

###### Am I making it more sustainable?

###### Am I making it easier for someone else to help those who can't help themselves?

##### Am I helping those who don't know a solution exists?



### Understanding your circumstance


### Understanding your options

## Identity

### What identity do I hold to the vision of my future self?

### Do my close friends share that future vision?

### What happens if I encounter a different version of my future self?

### Would I have the desire to surround myself with people who share this same vision?

### What happens to the old group of friends with whom I no longer share a vision?

### How would a group of people react to someone who doesn't share their same vision?

### Am I comfortable leaving those friends behind to assimilate into the new - where we share a same vision of the future?
