# Career Choices

The topic of career choices isn't one that ends at the start of high school and that's an important point to begin with.

I had an odd dream today and it kind of touched on this topic. Why I'm having dreams to prepare and educate today's youth, I'll point you to boredom and solitude.

It went something like this:

1. Me - What am I good at or interested in
2. You - What do you need from me and how can I best align my stewardship with fulfillment
3. The world - What do I and you have that the world lacks or what have I understood about myself and those in my immediate surrounding that I served that could scale to the masses

That was of course a dream and it ended with me deciding to be a counselor at a small school in the mountains in the middle of no where. Give or take some existential romance debacles and beautiful water with my eyes twinkling upon discovering kayaking, it was rather mundane. I do have however have my own developed thoughts on the topic of figuring out what you wanna do in life. Without further ado...
 
### Understanding myself

#### What do I care about?

##### Is there an existing problem I can find? What or why not?

##### Do I imagine the world running into trouble in the future?

###### What is my forecast based on?
(Market or population estimation sizing, census data, credible evidence, firm beliefs, close encounters, etc..)

###### If that forecast ends up being right, how does the world look in 1, 7, 17, 26, or 80 years?

####### Out of the 5 stages, which one do you intend being ready for serving?

#### Do others care?

##### Who cares?
(People impacted v.s. People whose impact will be most effective)

####### Who is tracking this problem and how will we know if it begins to worsen quicker than forecasted?

#### Inspiration 

##### Who inspired me to care about this problem?

###### What was the peak or highest turning point of their career?

###### What was their path to getting there?

###### Which of the opportunities and calls to duty will still exist by the time I enter the field?

#### What can I see myself doing to help?

##### What else is going on in my life by the time I start preparing for the field? (school / training / research)

##### What else is going on in my life by the time I enter the field? (internship / commercializion / new-grad)

##### What is most important for me to change between the start of preparation and the start of my career?

#### What kind of help does the problem need, by the time I enter the field and by time I intend to leave my mark?

#### Who am I helping?

##### Am I helping those who can't access a solution?

###### Am I making it cheaper?

###### Am I making it self-serve?

##### Am I helping those who aren't making effective use of existing solutions?

###### Am I making it more sustainable?

###### Am I making it easier for someone else to help those who can't help themselves?

##### Am I helping those who don't know a solution exists?

##### Am I helping those who don't know a problem exists?

### The problem v.s. Me solving the problem

#### How would I feel if I gave someone all the resources, solutions, & means to end the suffering or pain for those that face the problem? Without having ever interacted directly with those being helped...

##### How do I feel about the person being helped not knowing my name?

##### How do I feel about not knowing the name of the person being helped?

##### How do I feel about someone else taking credit for my efforts?

##### How do I feel about being forgotten from the history books for my contributions?

##### How do I feel about my close friends, family, and even life partner not know about my contributions?

##### How do I feel about my not being able to eliminate critics to preserve the anonymity in the contributions to the cause, people, and change resulting from the work I delivered?

### Understanding your circumstance

#### What can I do to acknowledge that today is a brand new day; create an opportunity; and take a chance on not changing?
(Results are not instant and you have to avoid the desire for change or zest in every part of your life; especially the path that needs to be paved - brick by brick)

#### What can I already designate as an activity to do that will help me remain calm when I begin to feel frustrated or restless so that I'm not interrupting the process of building a habit - day by day?
(No matter how mentally strong or motivated you are, the hard days will come and they will test you. This activity should be a fallback / backup / emergency activity that - when used in ocassion can be a light, quick, and painless way to keep the streak going if life or the day has got you cornered or stuck and the main activity seems like a mountain. At the early stages, you need to develope skill and see yourself succeed as quickly as possible; the glamor of numbers and letters shouldn't get in the way of building real confidence that comes from seeing tangible results that you can will and act into the world to change what's in front of you)

#### When can I schedule a "show & tell" to a friend or a mentor?
(Peer pressure is a good powerful weapon you can wield to your advantage. The fear of embarrassment, disappointment, or ridicule in front of others is scary; but it is the pain and agony that will build confidence that will last beyond the mirror. You're the only one making a big deal; whatever you put in front of someone is literally magic you just crafted into the world that didn't exist before. Okay, I'll be honest...."OMGG I STILL HAVEN'T SENT THE DOC...." is the quiet background music in my day right now. So let's do everything BUT *that* thing. House needs cleaning? Youth need saving from themselves? Let's do that!!! :P)


### Understanding your options

#### What are recurring themes in my road here, regardless of currently interested in, that reflect across projects, key conversations, highlight moments, or even favorite chapters in class?

#### What are the 8 words that repeat across all my experiences?
(You'll begin to uncover novel and new insights when you reach 8 so don't give up)

### Making choices

#### What conflict arrises when I group choices based on people, flexibility, autonomy, money, safety, and prospect?

## Identity

### What identity do I hold to the vision of my future self?

### Do my close friends share that future vision?

### What happens if I encounter a different version of my future self?

### Would I have the desire to surround myself with people who share this same vision?

### What happens to the old group of friends with whom I no longer share a vision?

### How would a group of people react to someone who doesn't share their same vision?

### Am I comfortable leaving those friends behind to assimilate into the new - where we share a same vision of the future?

### Social Media

#### Now that I've changed paths, course, or choice, how do I make way for the influencers, inspiration, community, and peers of my new universe within my existing social media accounts?

#### Given my interest in curating my profile to appeal to prospect jobs, mentors, or community, what does that mean for the "old me"?

#### Now that I'm finding all sorts of interesting content that's share-worthy, what should I expect from my audience - now mixed with people from my old interest and new?

##### How will these two different communities react in my comment section?

##### How will the people from my old community react to seeing posts from me about my new interest?

### Social Expectations

#### Which relationships do I see as foundational bedrocks where the world stops at the door?

### Family

##### What do I need to unlearn now that we've escaped that struggle?
