# Career Choices

The topic of career choices isn't one that ends at the start of high school and that's an important point to begin with.

I had an odd dream today and it kind of touched on this topic. Why I'm having dreams to prepare and educate today's youth, I'll point you to boredom and solitude.

It went something like this:

1. Me - What am I good at or interested in
2. You - What do you need from me and how can I best align my stewardship with fulfillment
3. The world - What do I and you have that the world lacks or what have I understood about myself and those in my immediate surrounding that I served that could scale to the masses

That was of course a dream and it ended with me deciding to be a counselor at a small school in the mountains in the middle of no where. Give or take some existential romance debacles and beautiful water with my eyes twinkling upon discovering kayaking, it was rather mundane. I do have however have my own developed thoughts on the topic of figuring out what you wanna do in life. Without further ado...

### The problem v.s. Me solving the problem

#### How would I feel if I gave someone all the resources, solutions, & means to end the suffering or pain for those that face the problem? Without having ever interacted directly with those being helped...

### Understanding your circumstance


### Understanding your options

## Identity

### What identity do I hold to the vision of my future self?

### Do my close friends share that future vision?

### What happens if I encounter a different version of my future self?

### Would I have the desire to surround myself with people who share this same vision?

### What happens to the old group of friends with whom I no longer share a vision?

### How would a group of people react to someone who doesn't share their same vision?

### Am I comfortable leaving those friends behind to assimilate into the new - where we share a same vision of the future?

### Social Media

#### Now that I've changed paths, course, or choice, how do I make way for the influencers, inspiration, community, and peers of my new universe within my existing social media accounts?

#### Given my interest in curating my profile to appeal to prospect jobs, mentors, or community, what does that mean for the "old me"?

#### Now that I'm finding all sorts of interesting content that's share-worthy, what should I expect from my audience - now mixed with people from my old interest and new?

##### How will these two different communities react in my comment section?

##### How will the people from my old community react to seeing posts from me about my new interest?

## A Better Life
