# Data Engineering

Personally, I need to get from 0-80% in this field so I'll be stacking and chaining two activities I'm driving right now. Which is a good segue to start this in...


## Shared Understanding

### Enumerate Questions

1. What is an activity?

2. What is an event?

3. What is a process?

4. What is active or inactive?

5. What has a file that can be associated with the activity?

6. Which activities could this task be traced to if it could?

7. How much force does it take to kill a process?

8. Can we service the activities we care about by managing their lifecycle?

9. What can we order for generation to follow the step by step trace of what processs an activity's task

10. What can I filter so that I can identify the activities I'm involved in and the ones that involved me, and the ones that outlive me if I'm stuck in a main activity?
