# Fairness

I once read somewhere that the world is built on a model of fairness. We look at the guy in the Alpha Romero and say, that's not fair that he gets to drive a Ferrari. We look over at the mext town and say it's not fair that they have more Starbucks locations that we do. I look over my shoulder sometimes and say it's not fair that there's no one there; just me left musing my acts with no reaction to deflect the blame towards to save me from the long road ahead of - sigh - change.

The world demands fairness and as do I. Though I do plan on having Lewis Hamilton in my rear view mirror one day.


Fairness is a complex topic and it seems like society at large (I gotta find a better alternative for this) will go to any length to achieve fairness. Is fairness equity or equality? I assert the world seeks neither; just the absense of distubance of peace for the fragile egg called fairness. Who knows? I hear it hatched a few guys with mustaches
