# Fairness

## Memo 1

I once read somewhere that the world is built on a model of fairness. We look at the guy in the Alpha Romero and say, that's not fair that he gets to drive a Ferrari. We look over at the mext town and say it's not fair that they have more Starbucks locations that we do. I look over my shoulder sometimes and say it's not fair that there's no one there; just me left musing my acts with no reaction to deflect the blame towards to save me from the long road ahead of - sigh - change.

The world demands fairness and as do I. Though I do plan on having Lewis Hamilton in my rear view mirror one day.


Fairness is a complex topic and it seems like society at large (I gotta find a better alternative for this) will go to any length to achieve fairness. Is fairness equity or equality? I assert the world seeks neither; just the absense of distubance of peace for the fragile egg called fairness. Who knows? I hear it hatched a few guys with mustaches 

## Memo 2

Fairness is a complex phenomenon in the world. It's not something that made sense to me until I found myself in a situation that I considered just about assymetric as See Saw with a bunny on one end and Fat Albert on the other (yes, I also didn't know either). The more I harpoon over it, the more I assert what ought' and shoulda' happened. I think about wether a feather could have been on the other end for the bunny. Maybe it's a bird that takes flight or maybe it's just a feather that would have taught the bunny a paradoxical lesson about flight. Whatever it was; as long as it wasn't what happened - anything but. It's just *not* fair.
