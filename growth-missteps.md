# Looking Inwards

One of the most challenging aspects of managing the rush of emotions in progress is not being able to cope with how insulting the steps there seem - especially when you see that you've been already on that path once before. The kind of answers that would ease worry and doubt. The kind of answers that would provide closure. The kind of answers that make you whole again. I'm not sure how to characterize the element of life where the start of rebuilding begins to shine hope and then a whirl of questions and frustration about why I'm celebrating a baseline point from years ago begins to wash over me. How incredibly demoralizing to be in the midst of joy about momentum and then the agony of accepting that these are in fact baby steps in comparison to leaps of yesterday. Still working on this and finding it evermore difficult with age. Right now, I can just chalk it up to growth missteps.
