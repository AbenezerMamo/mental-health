# Lost Time

On the trend of tear jerking content, wanted to share a burden ive been carrying for too long: lost time.

About a decade (10 years) ago, I took a hard look at my life and decided I needed to be realistic about how special I am. My mom and dad can tell the stories of our path; and theirs is much more interesting than mine for sure - so I'll just focus on what it all means.

I came into America at the age of 10 and now I'm about to turn 25. Though in my eyes I'm really just 15; it never felt like life began until I got here.

Since the age of 14/15, I've been building online communities and learning how to serve the internet and all its odd members; albeit much less cool back then.

It started with ElitePowered - powered by the elite. We believe everyone is elite at what they do and if you can bring them together, you can truly empower the world.

It began with 1 friend, 1 TF2 server, and a Steam group that grew to hundreds of gaming clan members and hundreds of thousands of community members. With 100+ game servers world wide reaching millions of gamers, it amounted to 1,000+ (thousands) of gamers playing on our game servers concurrently at any given time world wide; while I was in school or losing sleep at night working on Debian instances and latency improvements before the next TF2 update. With me were world class heroes that, at times paid but mostly volunteered, ran the entire community with forums, events, Teamspeak servers, and even a 9v9 Highlander eSports team. When I say world class, I mean it. Never in my time in tech have I met talent that matched the kind and genius work that I saw in our community. The only exception was my friend and school classmate Jesse who built TxTAdvice with me and then went on to lead the open source trading project that probably made thousands of traders globally rich. That kid is nuts and then went on to be later be validated by Google.

Except the trading project, all of the above was while I was still in high school. *dab*

So yeah, I traded in my childhood to make sure I built myself to be someone that would live up to my high school yearbook quote; and carry the torch for my mans Steve (RIP)

After spending time helping you get laid, facilitate the communication, and fund the democracy in the open that would ensure the outcomes could prosper...I've ended up in a position where I'd likely be next in line to give the internet O.G.'s a break b/c the alternative is hiring an exec team that even 2 boxes of pizza can't feed. So what did I do with that power and privilage? Ensure you could bring your full self, not have to change your hype music, and rub off the impeccable ethics and morals that I grew into. Lastly, you can smoke some weed here and there without the DEA and society hounding you for speed balling. Somewhere, Obama is shaking his head. Somewhere else Italians & Jewish people continue to be stunned. But everywhere, I wanted people to aspire to be the Abenezer Mamo of everything. A behavioral economist with desire to win as a team and leave each member with the abilities and capabilites to lead their own heroic adventures and shape their own narratives as leaders who can build, enable, and empower in their own accord.

Looking back after a decade run, I'm proud to stand before as a man child side by side with these living legends who shaped the hybrid world for the better
