# Love Map

Once you reach the point in your marriage where you feel as though you're drifting, marriage counselors will step in and suggest that you and your partner create artifacts that you periodically revisit once you've been able to collect and document the unique and unmatched perspective on each other's growth, changes, aspirations, quirks, achievements, and overall change. They're called love maps.

No, I don't have marital issues; got prematurely stopped out of my stop loss in my last relationship. When I resort to trading speak, it's usually because I'm trying to deduce irrational human behavior into more quant & market principles to be a mirage for my insecurities & harbored doubts of modern romance. Leave me alone!

Okay, back to reality. After catching up with a good friend this week, this topic - love maps, not my heart break - brought to mind the reasons why my co-founders and I conceived of this little social revolution called TagMe. Yes, we got TagMe Inc. *sticks out tounge*


The premise behind TagMe was to reverse the one-to-many model of modern social works that force one - you, the individual - to tell a story to many.

We were fascinated by the possibilities of a many-to-one social network where you - the one in lens of the many in your life - are in control of the narrative but relinquish the role of capturing the precious moments to the few friends that regularly witness and attend the events that are akin to your mom's VHS tapes of your childhood - your very own little documentary made by all your closest pals. The content shows up in your library, once your friends tag you after capture, and you can decide if it should remain in your library or gain broader public visibility on your profile. Out of desire to not be responsible for a death, a depressive teen, revenge porn, and general human privacy violations, we felt it was the ethical and morally responsible decision to make everything private by default.


I loved this project and the people I dearly admired and respected gave up everything in their life and moved into a San Francisco house to build this company and app with me. Our main investor was a previous colleague of mine who let us live in his house. Yes, we did regularly sit down as a family and watch "Silicon Valley" episodes and we had a cat too :)

We ultimately failed to create a growth model that was able to retain the important privacy principles that we build the company with so we went out separate ways. We ended up as founders, PMs, physics wizards (not me), and working at art exhibits. I'm looking forward to seeing how history progresses and how social networks evolve. I'll give it to Zuck, wall-to-wall posting was an inspiration but that's as far as I'll go kissing up. Have you seen his CS50 lecture? ;)


Yes...love maps. Love maps help you gain a unique perspective on yourself and it can only be crafted by the close and special people in your life. I wish we had succeeded with TagMe in bringing that ethos to the general public. If this inspires you to build it better: I applaud you and will extend my product design skills to your conquest.

Love,
Rekindled
