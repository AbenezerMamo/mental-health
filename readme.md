# Mental Health

## Intro

### Why me?

We never ask this question; there's always one winner

### How long can you keep this up?

1. For as long as I continue to not want or need anything from this life.
2. As long as I continue my self-hatred that can beat all your hate for me combined.
3. For as long as people realize I don't have to be here and nor do I want to. Say the word and I'm out!
4. Not for long
5. For as long as you realize I'm not being kept from anything and derailed/slowed/outdone from anything
6. Until you believe it can't possibly be the same person
7. Honestly, I lost hope in all of you a long time ago but willing to believe old and young people could use a champion
8. Until I deplete all my savings, social capital, & patience
9. I'm on vacation; already did the whole showing up thing
10. Until your kids delete you from their name, reject your inverted morals and ethics, & remind you that they too will want to roam this earth and feel safe, loved, & respected wherever they go
11. Until God is clear on the fact that I have no intention in being an Adam, Samson, nor Noah

### Why now?

I can afford to take the reputation risk, lose social capital, and have earned the intellectual freedom.

### What is this NOT?

1. Me caring. About your opinion, fact check, and everything in between.
### Who is this for?

1. Doctors with outdated practice, study, & understanding of the needs that tomorrow's youth, today's newly weds, & yesterday's trauma have.
2. My homie who I'm so excited to enter fatherhood and his soon due baby girl. If you read this: tell him salmon or nothing. Your mom would have mellowed him out so much he'll have me looking Mac. I'm so excited for you and hope you appreciate this gift; when you understand, give back.
3. Doctors willing to near lose their license for me because they understand that my work, lifestyle, & self-directive are like none other. Everyone else who shames my substance abuse can go find a new job. Ever heard of the diagonsis of elimination? Read a book.
4. My parents who have endured more than I can imagine. Still I'm asked when I plan on going to college, getting a job, and making something of myself. Stunned. Speechless. We're not on speaking terms rn and it's okay. *deep sigh* Like....What?! You can never satisfy these people...
5. Ilya, Sean, Jeremy, & Peter (both)
6. My sister who makes it clear she doesn't look up to me, doesn't care, and constantly rolls her eyes at anything I do. I hope to be just like you when I grow up.
7. Ali - who makes me wish I learned how to win as a team and played a team sport in school
8. Jose - who has showen me what being a real man is; what the military can do; and has made me break down into tears with one kind act
9. My Green Card, DEA, & California
10. "Your campaign." Savage. Wow. Oh my God. Floored.
11. Make School community

### Where can I help?

1. Live life to the fullest and stop fearing about the system collapsing. When you grow up and can make time for it, I know you will be there to step in and fill my place.
2. Rest assured that people cared before you, while you have other that need you to exclusively, and even when you are no longer around to. That's the "village" they keep talking about
3. It starts with you, your own, and not worrying too much about your very own. I intend to enable change that doesn't need me to be around to be made, felt, or live changed

### Is it too late for me?

I once found a great video in my discovery for "how to design your life" that had advice along the lines of: "you're not late for anything and we don't should on anybody. We will meet you where you are."

Another great advice was by a friend and roommate of mine who quickly shut down my attempt at prompting my sad violen about life moving too fast with: "I am exactly where I'm supposed to be." It made me pause and I let a sigh of relief and thanked him for forever changing my life and how I time it.

One other insight was from a book called "Thank You for Being Late". A great read and I was only 1/4 of the way through when I left it but it left me with a calm and poised outlook on the slow and winding pace of innovation. Since then I've been unrattled by the new this and that. Instead I've taken opportunities to look backwards at history to see why and how things really evolved.

Finally: two of my great mentors have been really instrumental in providing both reading & a calming sounding board as every turn in my career seemed to be a looming with doom, runaway train, & indecision filled with turmoil about what I'm missing out on or where I should have been by now.
* One's advice was: "we'll be back here in a year laughing about it and you're just in your usual ways of flipping about about this" (pretty much). I only stared back in confusion & awe as this well off dude was watching my life fall apart and *that* was all he had to offer -_-. Awful awful joke because he ended up being right and would you know it...it was the exact same spot too. sigh...
* Second's advice are really cryptic and we usually take walks so my ADHD was having a field day. Sapiens was a book he recommended and turns out humans were flipping their * for a long time in really odd ways.

Lastly, everyone in the Make School community has seen me gone through cycles of change filled with..."bruh, I swear to * this * feels cinematic. No one is going to believe me and I just need you to know it's enough that you're here to witness this."

*ahem* I used to come to my last girl with: "Don't even get me started on what this @ said and tried to pull off today.." I also imagine that to be the way all my mentors start their nights off saying about me. I live for it - I swear I love pretending like I don't even know. It antagonizes them and it fuels my inner troll. Boss moves. That's what you get for being so kind - you...I don't even know anymore..."

So as you can see, it takes poise. Comes naturally. Easy. *deep breath...and then begins to inhale* Yeah, no, I don't smoke because I like getting stoned. Okay, that's a half lie / half truth. I am working on better coping mechanisms. *cuts into Bo level practice* *turns* "Have I told you about my weekend plans with the lady?"

At almost a quarter of a century now, I do feel so much more calm and at ease about life. Today, and almost everyday of the past few years, I did all that I needed and wanted to do. I feel at peace with my the pace life is taking with me and I don't feel like I'm in the hell that I once was in: feeling guilty about what I'm doing / where I am currently because I felt like I should / needed to be doing something / be somewhere else. It's been damaging to my relationships with friends and family; my love life; & my own personal sanity.

For the first time ever this year: I felt like I could finally see my death as a happy and joyful passage into God's kingdom. My favorite saying now is: "I don't need this; my daddy got 2 kingdoms!" haha thank you Chris Rock & team

Truly, it's been such an amazing honor to be at peace. No bulletproof vest or glass; same meals and drinks as anybody; and I will chase the same opportunities and games like the rest of you - and crush you at it because I don't want to hear sh*t about why I had it different. If you * with me and I don't do anything, it's so you're forced to change without saying Abe did this or that to you. I ain't do nothin' punk! Change; stop looking behind you!

### When will this actualize itself into substantive action?

## 0 to 1

### Marker for where we are today

#### If we break this down even more, what is the turning poking in the last hear?

#### What parts of it are reproducible under the right conditions and circumstances?

### What evidence can we create for observed inertia in the early days of 0?

### Where can we move 1 step towards that gets us an order of magnitude multiplier to tackle 1 to 10?

## 1 to 10

### What are the opportunities that could be low hanging fruit once we've saturated the obvious?

### Ehat is non-inertia defined as?
(0)

## 10 to self-serve

### What is the minimum viable tangible that can make one, anyone, capable and able to grow the pie with self directive?

## Self-serve to service

### What services are rudimentary for us to hsndicap the assymetric advances made that are orthogonal to the shared collective's ability to retain the continuous game?

## Service to "in-service-of"

### What can we automate to define the manual that can guide leadership?

## When will this no longer serve its purpose and be decomissioned out of service?

### How do I service the self-serve tools along the way?
