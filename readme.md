# Mental Health

## Intro

### Why now?

I can afford to take the reputation risk, lose social capital, and have earned the intellectual freedom.

### What is this NOT?

1. Me caring. About your opinion, fact check, and everything in between.
### Who is this for?

1. Doctors with outdated practice, study, & understanding of the needs that tomorrow's youth, today's newly weds, & yesterday's trauma have.
2. My homie who I'm so excited to enter fatherhood and his soon due baby girl. If you read this: tell him salmon or nothing. Your mom would have mellowed him out so much he'll have me looking Mac. I'm so excited for you and hope you appreciate this gift; when you understand, give back.
3. Doctors willing to near lose their license for me because they understand that my work, lifestyle, & self-directive are like none other. Everyone else who shames my substance abuse can go find a new job. Ever heard of the diagonsis of elimination? Read a book.
4. My parents who have endured more than I can imagine. Still I'm asked when I plan on going to college, getting a job, and making something of myself. Stunned. Speechless. We're not on speaking terms rn and it's okay. *deep sigh* Like....What?! You can never satisfy these people...
5. Ilya, Sean, Jeremy, & Peter (both)
6. My sister who makes it clear she doesn't look up to me, doesn't care, and constantly rolls her eyes at anything I do. I hope to be just like you when I grow up.
7. Ali - who makes me wish I learned how to win as a team and played a team sport in school
8. Jose - who has showen me what being a real man is; what the military can do; and has made me break down into tears with one kind act
9. My Green Card, DEA, & California
10. "Your campaign." Savage. Wow. Oh my God. Floored.
11. Make School community

### Where can I help?

### When will this actualize itself into substantive action?

## 0 to 1

### Marker for where we are today

### Where can we move 1 step towards that gets us an order of magnitude multiplier to tackle 1 to 10?

## 1 to 10

### What are the opportunities that could be low hanging fruit once we've saturated the obvious?

## 10 to self-serve

### What is the minimum viable tangible that can make one, anyone, capable and able to grow the pie with self directive?

## Self-serve to service

### What services are rudimentary for us to hsndicap the assymetric advances made that are orthogonal to the shared collective's ability to retain the continuous game?

## Service to "in-service-of"

### What can we automate to define the manual that can guide leadership?

## When will this no longer serve its purpose and be decomissioned out of service?

### How do I service the self-serve tools along the way?
