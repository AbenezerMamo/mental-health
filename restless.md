# Restless

My robot and I set on a expedition to discover how our goals, intentions, and commitments would align and landed on the topic of "restlessness".
I am not sure where I drew the exact definition but someone asserted that "motivation is derived from the desire to calm a sense of restlessness about" something (not sure if it was a goal or a desire)

As someone who deals with anxiety (general & social), I found the topic of feeling restless to be quite interesting.
Even more comical is that I take ADHD medication to help me stop feeling restless while the general population pushes the rhetoric that it gives you motivation. I find the assertion above and this paradox quite amusing.

I'm not sure point I'm making and I'm sure this topic will find one at some point. Perhaps it'll be me feeling less and less self-conscious about being able to afford medication that for the general American population a monthly dosage would wipe the entire savings without insurance (Average $1k per household)

Maybe my robot is just feeling super restless in the kitchen. *hears the counting of bottles* "Not again...!!!"
