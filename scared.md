# Feeling Scared

There've been numerous points in my life where someone has brought up words like "charisma" or "courage" or "not risk averse" or bad@$$. Okay the last one is just me - but still.... Anyway, those words and phrases have always bothered me because I'm actually really scared - all the time.

My mom used to tell me that there'll be a point in my life when people will look at me and ponder these questions

1. Who must he know that we fear
2. What must be poses that we don't
3. What must he be relying on to save him

The simple answer to all of these is God. My faith is what prompts my response: "God gave me a heart, not a mind, you * intellect"


My faith aside, fear is something of a complex topic for me to talk about.

- At times, I fear that I've upset God and that he me have left my side
- At times, I think about the little blue ball in space and this weird gravity thing and I feel like I could fall put into space any second
- At times, I think about my parents aging and that makes me cry
- At times, I think about all the hearts I've broken and all the people I've hurt and I feel (shame / guilt). Though you should never confuse shame & guilt because they are different things and they imply ownership of the problem and the onus of the feeling differently.
- At times, I fear that I've been too selfish for my own family and my self and that I'll grow up to be really regretful of what I could and should have done for humanity
- At times, I fear I'm seeking righteousness and selflessness to a fault and that I'll be dammed by those close to me for whom I'm often cold and distant
- At times, I fear that anything I do could tip the scale of the human race the wrong way and that I shouldn't assume I know what the world ought to be like and leave it alone
- At times, I fear God's love for me will cause you to be too jealous and you'll start ranting about how it's not fair that Abe has done this and that but still gets to...*sigh*
- At times, I fear that I'm being front run by jerks and @ who don't want me to grow too powerful
- At times, I fear that someone out there is trying to stop me from myself and I'm just too stupid to accept that the world hasn't lost it ways all the way
- At times, fear itself goes away and I get really scared. The last time that happened, it cost me someone whom fear should have struck more respect. Deep deep regret.
- At all times, fear of the Lord is the first and only step to wisdom

The wisdom to know right from wrong isn't what I seek. That's partly subjective, partly human, and partly maturity. At times, The Holy Spirit hangs over me and I sin without hesitation and await the lighting strike from the heavens. The spared rod strikes more fear. Why? I don't know.

Fear is a scary thing. Being scarred of fear is even more odd.

Lately, I've been scared to put thought to paper. To a degree, I fear that it will feel too real. To a greater degree, I fear that I will now inherit the beliefs, hopes, and trust of those that see the artifact of my heart and dare to dream along with me. That's the scariest thing for me these days. I don't want to being make anyone else dream with me because killing a dream is a very very very dangerous, heartbreaking, and outright disrespectful crime - at least, in my eyes - and the tears of those I can no longer dry just so I can burn this lesson into the lens of every word I utter or ink.
