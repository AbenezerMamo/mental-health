As you grow up, you come to the realization that the world forgives you more than you will forgive yourself. That guilt you carry isn't in my qualifications to unravel but I do hope you keep watch of it. Self destructive behavior can show up in all kinds of ways:

1. Avoiding seeing someone
2. Canceling plans
3. Getting stuck in patterns or trying to break a pattern (stuck)
4. Holding back on your own introduction
5. Cursing yourself under your own breath
6. Not getting what you enjoy and settling for the bare minimum; especially when it won't cost you much more
7. Freezing when you get a complement. (Learn how to say thank you)
8. Not accepting love (do your own research)
9. Not being able to understand when a drug is doing work for you v.s. when you're doing the work for you (and the journey of acceptance that they're the same - at least to me now; prescribed)
10. Not knowing how to be still with your own thoughts (try to beat your last record, continuously)
And more hits from our generation's best....

Watch that self talk gents and ladies. Be mindful of what you nurture.  Words have power so use them wisely.
