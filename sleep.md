# Sleep

I'm feeling the good kind of restless tonight. The kind where I'm so jazzed about what tomorrow might have in store that I can't decide between staying awake all night or going to sleep. No, I'm not abusing anything. Okay, I'm abusing my one secret super power: relinquishing control of the day to God so that I can be at equal with all the rest of the beings in the world. If God intends for me to be the one to see tomorrow and what it has to offer, I will awaken from whatever runs through my mind. If not, I'll find a peaceful passage into my Father's Kingdom to which my belief and faith in Jesus Christ shall grant. Okay, enough Sunday school: let's get to the actual secret that you can apply...


Surrender the world and you shall awaken into it once more if God decides it so; and if not - you'll be none the wiser. I'll miss you and so will the rest of us but hopefully you find passage to where you own set of beliefs take you.

In this world: you only have two choices:

1) Feel [insert emotion here]
2) Nothing at all

The gift of life is to accept the challenge and preset given to you to choose option 1 - to feel.

Today, I feel excited for the world. There are many different versions of me that feel all sorts of ways: the past and the present. The future is only what awakens.

Have a blessed night!

Love,
A choice to feel <3
