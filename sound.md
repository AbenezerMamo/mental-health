# Sound

This will be my last contribution, ever.

After suffering from an inhumane attack on (what only became clear to me today) my hearing, I am very amgdy, upset, and completely heartbroken.

I had no idea that the one sense we humans can lose once and forever would be the way that the world would attack me.

My balance, my musical talent, and my ability to have been able to hear the sound of my future potential child seemed to be taken from me.

I imagine this won't be the first or last time this will happen. To rob humans of their earning potential, physical gifts, and their sanity...attack with sound and hearing will be dangerous force.

For what I've lost, I will trace every neuron fired, every penny spent, and every second elapsed to not only get even but to put whoever is behind it...and make sure they're not worried about being left behind. This is the most inhumane, dispeciable, & disgusting attack I've ever imagined.


As a result: this conculdes all the hope and faith I had in humanity and I will cease all my contributions effective immediately.

Labyrinth is the word I looked up the definition of after the word navis to put it all together.


Yours truly,
Ship of Theseus
