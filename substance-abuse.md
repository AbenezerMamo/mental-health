# Substance Abuse

First I'd like to dedicate this to all those who don't find a SUBstance abuse with ADDerall comical. Okay, I'm trying to break the ice....*sigh* Queue "baby blue" and let's get on with it

Okay, back to the facts. No, don't go start abusing drugs blaming your ADHD and other beautiful qualities as an excuse, but good news is that you're probably just as likely to become a menace to yourself and society at large - without the drugs. (pseudo science on this point. ahem)

They do say you peak your criminal activities at about 17 and that's really your best opportunity to intervene before you lose a wondering soul to the correctional system, violent crimes (including stealing Twitter handles), and organized crime (to Ethiopians, the Harlem Shake does fit in this category). Not sure what solutions can be but planting trees around the troubled teen sounds like a good first step. Might help them strain away from criminal activites - politicans and statistians are screaming loud from the rooftops!

Now, the way to really contfront a substance abuse issue is to understand the enviroments, triggers, fallback / relapse paths, support systems, and the individuals acceptance of the underlying trauma or unfair life disadvantage they're dealing with. I would say group therapy joke about taking turns but I'd just be taking the seriousness out of this topic far too much.

I like to think this is how your conversation would transpire with a wise @ clown in your life.

Be safe kids. Always have a trip sitter and always have a friend you can call that can come get you from whatever situation you're stuck or lost in. Degenerate responsibly - we need you alive.

P.S. Be careful, some people will give up on you and that's damage a translplant or therapy won't heal. The sooner you learn this the sooner you'll take ownership. Only you can push out of the shield you hide under - and it's got a price of gold with none of the stable asset for value storage or the shinyness
