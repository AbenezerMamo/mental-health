* How do you talk about mental health to your African / imigrant family?

hahahahah jajajaj lul! Good one!

* Why don't you just focus?

-_- / * insert my sister's eye rolls here*

* Well, did you just watch Breaking Bad? You know it's literally meth right?

To some of you, this might actually be news. Nothing attractive with substance abuse with Adderall (the brand name medication) / Meth-amp-hatimine salts

* Well, why don't you just lean on something else?

You're an idiot. That * will give you paranoia. I'm pretty sure they taint it b/c you, *ahem* we *ahem*, abuse it.

* Well why don't you just smoke to relax?

You are suggesting what is literally their secret plot to cause you trauma. They know you won't speak up because you know you're not supposed to mix Adderall & weed?

Sorrry, couldn't hear you over...*sigh*

* I feel like my Adderall is making me...X....why is...Y...happening to me; and why can't I...Z...zzz?

Literally you're an idiot. They think you'll get ahead of others. By they i mean everyone who doesn't have ADHD.

If you have ADHD: (this is for me and may not apply to all) Adderall makes time slow down; literally makes you stop freaking moving around and pacing so much; makes it easier to break down tasks; and makes it not so scarry and daunting to start that task.

* Well, that sounds magical! Why can't I get some too?
If you are suspected of trying to game and lie your way to it, you'll be asked to take a neuropsychological exam

* How was your neuropsychological exam?
I took off 3 months from work, slept off all the illegal Adderall (hopefully) and weed, and caused a collapse to my entire romantic relationship so I can take the exam and do my absolute best on it so I cam really find out if I had ADHD. My ex thiught I slept all day because I would rather not spend time with her. Really: I'm scared sh*tless of the DEA and didn't want to test their grace and patience any more than I was. They know. I know they know. There is no such thing as gettign away with it. Also, I'm an important assset to this country who works on highly sensative work and am being watched like a hawk. That's a blessing and a curse. It means I live like a normal kid but will put you down the moment you endanger the multi billion dollar companies and billions of users I am entrusted to serve. It's a weird thing no one speaks to me about and I don't ask. I try my best to only be around anybody and everybody but limit what I share and teach to those who I pray won't let me down. At anytime I could be in the sh*t for my b.s. but never let it be a reason to hide and be blackmailed. I'll run to the agency and bureau like a snitch, no - literally (had to Google that; hence civilian). Given that, I take all and anything to the grave. Not a sponge nor a manilla would push me to crack (hence a civilian). No, I'm not hiding behind some immunity and can face time and justice just as easily (100x more - trust me) as you. So to conclude: I have Adderall blessed by the DEA for life :)

* How did you react to this amazing gift of a life time?

By breaking into tears that I've instantly wiped decades off my life (10 years x2 or x3 or x4 or x5); I will never be able to be an athlete without killing my heart even further; and my partner now has to be met with the news that the world is more important than her and our future kids whom I'll be abandoning and leaving lonely to suffer in agony, lonliness, and without a father figure or life long partner.

*whew*

Okay...yeah...don't even get me started on taking meth, having some powerful agency hold power over you, and literally having your life fall apart if you miss 1 day or dosage. Currently, I've delayed and rescheduled my doc appointment by weeks bc I'm not on my medication. It's so funny but not. Need my meds to get my meds but don't have my meds so I can't put together a plan and execute on it to get my meds. Meanwhile: my finances, sanity, self respect & dignity, and time are burning in a dumpster fire. As soon as I'm on my meds, things feel normal again and I feel so f*cking humilated by thr weeks that just passed by.

* Why does't the DEA care that you're...?

They laugh as you sleep all day. That's what happens without your meds. Then the above happens. Endlessly until you die, run out of money, fail your work & responsites, and be a burden on everyone. Not in that order and sometimes in mixtures of those things.

* Why in the world does anyone take this drug?

Because our brain is missing chemicals that you have that make organization, execution, and not losing your * easy as 123 and ABC. For us, where do we even begin?

* So, you're not getting ahead in life, work, and everything because of the drug?

We also happen to sometimes overlap with natural gifts and talents that stay hidden and burried by our lack and inability to....(see above)

* When did you first take Adderall?

Pray for me. Please. I think 20 or 21 occassionally.

* When did you get diagnosed?

Please ask Jesus to please come; like now! Right after leaving Twitter (Dec 2019) so (March 2020)

Now!!!

* I heard you were Ethiopian?

We gave you coffee. The original stimulant. I'm out!
