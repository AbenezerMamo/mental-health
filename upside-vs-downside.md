# Creating Upside v.s. Protecting Downside

## Personal Note

One of my greatest frustrations as a menace adulting into God fearing wisdom and conscienceness is dealing with the world's desire to test wether or not I'm more useful testing the systems to protect downside or leaving me be so I can help refurbish and remodel the systems to create upside. Without any hesitation, I am proud to say that I'm very conscious about how capable I could become at turning the world upside down if I surround myself with people who feed me idiologies of agony about the powers that be - human or not. As such, I try to steer clear of things that'd land me in prison. More importantly, I have become well aware that I have to be vigilant about the influences and voices that I expose myself to because wether I like it - or know it - or not, there will be people whose interest is in playing us v.s. them; just about the most dangerous ideology of them all. Having considered what I am able and unable to accept the onus of willing into the world - regardless of my current capabilities - I've vowed to never get in the business or politics of protecting downside. This means security, public office, judge, or even simply a moral stool are all of the table. The path - an uphill battle - of creating upside seems a lot more of what the world needs and what I feel the world deserves from someone who is just as capable and able - but unwilling - to protect downside. That's just something society will have to accept and I hope history will appreciate; all of which are second to earning God's grace in the process.

This topic holds a lot of meaning to me and I hope it'll serve as an explanation to why I choose to not act or believe in anything but the select few things I curate with time - looking both forward and backward. These may not reflect your ideals or match your perspective of your world but you have to regard them with the mindset that I'm not willfully carrying myself and that - to my own accord - all of these carry merit & logical validity in my eyes and ears; the ones that see and hear all but protecting downside.

Of more importance is the weight that I feel this topic carries on my generation - and the ones to come - as we look within to lick our adventure between us v.s. ourselves, us v.s. each other, or us v.s. the world.
