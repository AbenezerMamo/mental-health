4. Cool, now zoom out! Try to imagine the building you're in. Go and come back when you see it!

7. Okay, don't rush just yet. Imagine seeimg the lights on at night. Kind of like you're 2 minutes and like 15 seconds from touch down. Stay in your state and cme
back in 15 seconds or so

8. Cool! Now imagine a pin ! in your state aaaaaaaaand zoooomm!!! Come back quickly

12. Okay, cool! Now we're on the same page I hope
13. Let's try a quick little exercise: spin the globe ball but not all the way around. Just kind of shake it up and down. A little to the right and just a tinny bit to the left. Play with it and come back

14. Are you starting to kind of notice the other countries? Don't get too stirred up just yet; it should feel kind of scary.
15. There's this weird empty space all around; and holy oh my my my! We're kind of just floating in space. *gulp* Okay don't stay too long hurry back...

18. This time I want you to go back but imagine seeing yourself from the same position you were jusy at. Come back when you give up...

19. Back so quickly ha? Interesting...
20. How about if you imagined the little magic of love, change, & happiness just lighting up the entire world from just where your ! pin is...

21. Not gonna lie...I belive you can and you should too
22. You can go back soon but let me leave you with one personal note

Pale Blue Dot & planet exploration aren't things I came up with. In fact, these things are scary, complicated, and jusy give me a headache and make me dizzy with worry, fear, and outright paranoia. But...

I know you're going to grow stronger and each time you do this you will end up asking your own questions about the world, how we got here, what it means, and what means we have to protect, preserve, and conserve this beautiful home of ours

I'm sure you know by now where I stand religously and you don't need me to remind you I can science too. But, a conscious...now that is an odd one to figure out

This year has been a renewal of hope, faith, and cautious optimism kindled with free will that warms with fragily tender scorch, eraticly engulfing guide zig zagged with anxiety massaged with fresh air, and scattered gazes that cast larger shadows as my figure leads my fear behind in a dance with then sun and the stars. Fear of God, relentless pursuit of grace, and bountiful forgiveness I don't deserve have lifted me from the depth of hell I seek to climb out of in my soul as I face the devil in the mirror. What I see I never liked and wished it could be you that could have embodied all the blessings that I hold captive in this broken shell of mine. The darkness creeps, the streams of growing conscious drown me in sorrow, and the promise of everlasting love hide underneath the shame, guilt, and self-resentment. I am human and sometimes that seems to be the only guard I can find as I continue to reject God's forgivness that washes over me. For you, I only ask God that he not extend his reach too far for me and save it for you. I am mortal and my sins cast a grief that I worry even God may see past. That I can't allow and for that I simply ask to spend the rest of my days being just as any other; nothing more and hopefully nothing less - and equally blessed. With that, I hope you can find some comfort in the unknown, the uncertain, and in all that you fear or doubt. I don't annoint myself but I do try to keep my eyes straight and not look back. I hope you find meaning and comfort from what I extend neutrally to all but with just me and you in mind. The best thing you can do for another is to bring 1, and only 1, as you zoom in and out of the world. This time, your problems seem more calming as you see them not just as your own. As they say, "no man is an island." You; you and I; we're not alone. Now, go make the most of life! You're getting my all fuzzy again!
